# Variable Selection and Inference

This repository is part of a research project exploring variable selection and inference using various statistical and machine learning techniques. The project is implemented using Jupyter Notebooks and includes methods such as LASSO, Forward Selection, Backward Elimination and Stepwise Selection.

## Project Overview

Variable selection and inference are critical components of statistical modeling. This project examines the following methods for variable selection:

- **LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator):** A regularization technique that shrinks coefficients of less important variables to zero.
- **Forward Selection:** A stepwise method that begins with an empty model and adds the most significant variables one by one.
- **Backward Elimination:** Starts with all variables and removes the least significant one at each step.
- **Stepwise Selection:** A combination of forward and backward selection, balancing between adding and removing variables.

The study aims to understand the behavior of these methods in identifying significant predictors in high-dimensional datasets.
